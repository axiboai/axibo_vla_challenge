# AXIBO VLA Challenge: Data Collection, Fine-Tuning & Real-Time Inference

**Target Model:** AgileX PiperX (6-DOF + gripper), https://github.com/agilexrobotics/piper_isaac_sim/tree/master/piper_x_description/urdf

**Simulation Environment:** Genesis (please visit the [official repo](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis) for install instructions)

## Introduction

At AXIBO, we are building manipulation policies that run on real hardware in unstructured environments. This challenge evaluates your ability to take a Vision-Language-Action model from nothing to something that actually works: collecting your own data, fine-tuning a checkpoint on it, evaluating it honestly, and getting it to run smoothly in the loop.

We are deliberately not giving you a dataset. In our experience the data engine is where most VLA projects succeed or fail, so we want to see how you build one. You are free to use any open checkpoint and any training framework, but everything must be collected and evaluated in Genesis on the provided PiperX asset.

## The Tasks

### Task 1: Build a Data Engine

Collect your own demonstration dataset for a language-conditioned pick-and-place task using a scripted policy.

* **Method:** Use Genesis's [batched IK](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/blob/main/examples/tutorials/batched_IK.py) (or any other IK method you prefer) to script the motion and collect across many randomized environments in parallel. Teleoperation is not expected, automated collection is the point.
* **Scene:** A tabletop containing a **red cube, a red cylinder, and a blue cube**. Each episode is paired with a natural language instruction naming the target object.
* **Export:** Save to a standard format (LeRobot is fine, or justify your own).
* **Challenge:** You are choosing the action space, the observation setup, the randomization ranges, and how many episodes to collect. Document each of these decisions and why you made it. We care more about this reasoning than about the episode count.

### Task 2: Fine-Tune and Evaluate Under a Declared Protocol

Fine-tune an open VLA checkpoint on your own data and report how well it works.

* **Model:** Pick any open VLA checkpoint. Tell us why you picked it.
* **Evaluation:** Report success rate with a **stated trial count, seed list, and failure taxonomy** (missed grasp, grasped and dropped, wrong object, never reached, etc.). An aggregate number with no protocol behind it tells us very little.
* **Language conditioning:** Because two objects share a colour and two share a shape, the target cannot be identified from colour alone. Hold the scene fixed, swap the instruction, and show us that the policy is actually binding both attributes.
* **Generalization:** Report performance on a **blue cylinder**, a combination you never collected data for.

### Task 3: Make Inference Smooth, Not Just Fast

Naive synchronous execution stalls the arm at every chunk boundary while the next chunk is computed. Remove that stall.

* **Methods:** At least one of the following: asynchronous inference that overlaps compute with execution, temporal ensembling across overlapping chunks, real-time chunking, or engine-level work such as `torch.compile`, TensorRT, or quantization. More than one is welcome.
* **Deliverable:** p50 and p99 inference latency before and after, a smoothness metric (joint jerk or velocity discontinuity at chunk boundaries), and evidence that task success rate did not degrade.
* **Challenge:** Latency and smoothness are easy to improve if you are willing to break the policy. Show us you didn't.

### Task 4 (Optional, but Strongly Recommended): Learn From Your Own Experience with RECAP

Improve the Task 2 policy using its own rollouts rather than more demonstrations, following the core mechanism of [RECAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14759) (π*0.6). Tasks 1–3 are the bar.

* **The loop:** Deploy your fine-tuned policy autonomously and log rollouts with rewards derived from simulator state. On failed rollouts, hand control to your Task 1 scripted policy to produce a correction. Train a value function on the resulting mixture of demonstrations, autonomous experience, and corrections, then fine-tune the policy conditioned on binarized advantage estimates from that value function, and condition on high advantage at inference.
* **Note on scope:** RECAP's first stage is offline-RL pre-training of a model that supports advantage conditioning. No open checkpoint provides this, so you will need to add the conditioning yourself and skip that stage. We know this, and we are not expecting the paper's results.
* **Deliverable:** Success rate against your Task 2 baseline under the same evaluation protocol, plus how you defined reward, how you triggered corrections, and what your value function actually learned. A correct implementation with a negative result and a clear account of why is a good submission. A reported improvement you cannot attribute to anything is not.
* **Challenge:** Rewards in simulation are cheap, which makes it easy to write a reward the policy can satisfy without doing the task. Tell us how you checked for that.

## Technical Stack & Constraints

* **Simulation:** Data collection and evaluation entirely native to Genesis.
* **Training:** Any framework. Any open checkpoint.
* **Compute:** Use whatever you have available. We are not evaluating how much compute you have access to, and if access is a problem please reach out, we can help.
* **Timeline:** Roughly one week for Tasks 1–3, and a second week if you take on Task 4. Tell us how you spent the time, and if you ran out of it, what you would have done next.

## Provided Assets

1. **PiperX Asset Pack:** URDF and meshes for the AgileX PiperX arm.

That is all. The dataset, the scene, and the evaluation harness are yours to build.

## Submission Requirements

Submit a private GitHub repository containing:

1. **Implementation Code:** Clean, documented Python for the collection pipeline, the training run, the evaluation harness, and the inference loop. Please add [@RVSagar](https://github.com/RVSagar) and [@ax-anoop](https://github.com/ax-anoop) to the repo.
2. **Trained Policy:** Saved weights, or a clear pointer to them if the checkpoint is large.
3. **README / Technical Report:**
   * Your data engine decisions (action space, observations, randomization ranges) and the reasoning behind them.
   * Your evaluation protocol, results, and failure breakdown, including the instruction-swap and held-out-combination results.
   * What you did for inference, with the before/after latency and smoothness numbers.
   * If you attempted Task 4: your reward definition, correction trigger, value-function training, and what changed.
   * A short summary of training hyperparameters.
4. **Results Video:** Screen recordings of the policy executing instructions in the Genesis viewer, including at least one instruction swap on a fixed scene.

## Evaluation Criteria

* **Data Engine Design:** Whether your randomization and action space choices reflect an understanding of what the policy needs to see in order to generalize.
* **Evaluation Rigor:** Whether we can trust your numbers. A well-specified protocol on a mediocre policy beats an impressive number we cannot reproduce.
* **Real-Time Thinking:** Whether you treated inference as a control-loop problem rather than a training-curve problem.
* **Reading a Paper Into Code (Task 4):** Whether you identified the load-bearing mechanism in RECAP and implemented it faithfully, independent of whether it improved your numbers. We weight an honest failed attempt here above a clean submission that skipped it.
* **Engineering Quality:** Effective, readable use of Genesis and your chosen training stack.
* If a task is not feasible or you cannot solve it, please explain to us the limitations of your solution and/or why it could not be done. Learning from engineering failure is a big part of this field and we are interested in hearing your thought process.
